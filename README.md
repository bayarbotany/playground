# Vigenère Cipher and Simple Transposition App

## About
This Node.js application encrypts and decrypts messages using a combination of the Vigenère cipher and a simple transposition method based on the "SEND TO" concept. The application allows users to input a plaintext or ciphertext and then perform encryption or decryption operations using a hardcoded key.

## Installation

To use this application, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Install dependencies.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:
node app.js


After starting the app, follow these steps:

1. Enter `1` for encryption or `2` for decryption.
2. Input the plaintext (for encryption) or ciphertext (for decryption) as prompted.

### Encryption
- The plaintext will be encrypted using the Vigenère cipher and then transposed using the "SEND TO" transposition method.

### Decryption
- The ciphertext will first be decrypted using the simple transposition method and then using the Vigenère cipher.
